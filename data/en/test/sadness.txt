Some questions you get on Twitter make you want to despair. We've been so battered. We complain but aren't convinced things could be better.

I know I've painted quite a grim picture of your chances. But if you simply stand here, we will both surely die.
I honestly feel nothing towards either of my parents and it's pretty depressing
@AshleyCWilson @MrDavidHobbs @IndyCaronNBCSN Glad the TV coverage was so successful because the attendance looked pretty dismal.
@OzelleM man imagine # Ultra is promoting carnival. I think u need to be the chairperson #serious. Cause am hearing nothing

Well I won't be doing a unboxing of the iPhone 7 plus on my channel until November sadly. Thank you @TMobile @Apple Staten Island NY smh
